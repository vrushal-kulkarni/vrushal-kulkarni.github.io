                            <p>I am currently a graduate student pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University and actively looking for Full-Time Positions from May 2018. I specialize in Full Stack Web Development, Cloud Computing(AWS), Android App development and Artificial Intelligence and like coding specially in Java. I have worked at New York Life as a Cloud Software Engineer(Co-Op) in New York City, from Jan to August 2017. Here I have worked on building a Web Portal for Compensation and Billing team for an Insurance as a Service platform using Angular 2, NodeJS and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
                                Prior to this, I have worked at Cognizant Technology Solutions in India where I have worked in the field of Android and Web Development.</p>
                                <p>My non-tech side of life includes playing chess, cricket, cooking, swimming, playing drums and backpacking to remote destinations.</p>

                                <p>I got an opportunity to work at New York Life- Labs right in the heart of the New York City.
                                    As a Cloud Software Engineer I developed an end-to-end compensation and billing web portal using Angular 2, Node.js and Amazon Web Services like S3, DynamoDB, RDS, SES and Lambda for an insurance platform.
                                    I implemented back-end Microservices in Node.js using Sequelize to integrate the backend data using Amazon RDS and deployed the application with Docker.
                                    Furthermore, we used AWS lambda, GraphQL and Serverless framework to build APIs to fetch data from DynamoDB.
                                    I also learnt designing wireframes using lucidchart to orchestrate the frontend development of the web portal.</p>

                                <p>I worked with Cognizant, India after my undergraduate studies as a Software engineer in the domain of Android and Web applications.
                                    I worked on building a module of an Android app for a major automobile industry client to measure various ride efficiency parameters like speed of the vehicle, distance travelled and carbon emission for a particular trip.
                                    We designed User Interface of the speedometer, using custom views, to integrate data with the server using web services.
                                    The app was developed using the concept of Q-Cards which basically calculated the score for an individual ride based on which cost effectiveness was subsequently calculated.
                                    A library was used to implement the algorithm at the back-end which was integrated with this Android App using the Java Wrapper Classes.
                                    I also worked on JMeter tool to test the server load for particular services for various projects.</p>

                                <p>I worked as a summer intern at Maven Systems, India on a project "Discrete Event simulator for Zigbee Protocol".
                                    I worked on Modeling a mesh algorithm to find optimal path in a mesh network of up-to 5000 modules by implementing a Deterministic Finite Automaton in C.
                                    We implemented a front-end for run-time visualization of actual packet movement using C#.NET.
                                    We also collected and analyzed various statistics about the number of collisions, round trip time, number of retries, time taken for transmission to improve the performance.
                                    Our team was very happy when we came to know that a product was implemented based on the simulation for several service providers in India.</p>

                                        The base foundation was laid by researching through Artificial Immune System theory profoundly and implementing CSA algorithm using Java and WEKA APIs.
                                        I had to formulate a code in Java to create an ARFF file from a high density OFF file using the concepts of feature vectors which were the input files for this algorithm.</p>
